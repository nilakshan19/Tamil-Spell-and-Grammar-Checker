# Tamil-Spell-and-Grammar-Checker

This project aims to build a Tamil Spell and Grammar Checker using a combination of traditional and modern approaches. The system is divided into two main components: Spell Checker and Grammar Checker. It leverages rule-based methods, machine learning (Random Forest), deep learning approaches (LSTM), and the Stanza library for part-of-speech tagging and error detection.
